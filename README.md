# Contract Read-Write

## Features

- **Contract Function Execution:** Users can execute various contract functions directly from the frontend by providing the required input parameters. The utility functions ensure that input data is correctly formatted before sending it to the smart contract.

- **Data Retrieval:** The frontend allows users to retrieve data from smart contracts, including reading and parsing contract state variables.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible for both experienced blockchain developers and beginners.

## Usage

To use this project, users need to connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and configure the contract address and ABI. Once connected, they can interact with the smart contract by selecting a function, providing input parameters, and executing transactions.
